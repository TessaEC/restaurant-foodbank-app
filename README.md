# Shared Lunch App

## Description

This full-stack app uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the templating engine, and MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database. This app provides a solution for global food resource waste by allowing food banks and restaurants to easily communicate their needs and food surplus in order to schedule donations.


## Usage

On the Shared Lunch website, users are welcomed with a fun, yet clean looking homepage. Without signing up, a user can get on the app and view all blog postings from organizations with leftover/extra food available to other organizations such as, food banks, homeless shelters, charities, etc. On each blog post the user will be able to see who is providing the food, a contact number and what and how much food is provided. An organization can sign up using their organization name, choosing a user name, and a password. The organization will then be logged in where they can use the dashboard to view all of their own posts and add new blog posts for food availabilities. The user can feel safe and secure knowing that this website is using security measures like authentication, authorization, and hashed passwords when a user signs up, logs in and while using the website.
